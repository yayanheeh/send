# LazySend.com
**Former name: Add9u.** Built with Vue, PWA.

It is so stupid that I have to add a new person every time to phone book because I want to send a WhatsApp message to him/her. 

That's why I make this simple progressive web application. It allows you to send a WhatsApp message to a person without adding him/her to the phone book.

## Demo

## Usage
It is a progressive web application. Just directly add it to your home screen if you have an Android device.

Want a quicker way? You can directly add the phone number with country code after `https://lazysend.com/whatsapp/`.

Take a phone number `94340634` with country code `+852` as an example:
```
https://lazysend.com/whatsapp/85294340634
```
